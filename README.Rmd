The goal of BeeRs is to explore a beer related dataset

## Installation

You can install the development version of BeeRs from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pmoizerv/BeeRs")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(BeeRs)
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
almost(x, N = 1)
```

## Data

The data come from Kaggle

-   [Beer production per state](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/beer-production)
-   The data describe the production of beers in USA state from 2008 to 2019

## Function

The main function is `almost()` that compute the mean with an increased variance with increased beer consumption up to 7 beers, then is no longer able to calculate ...
